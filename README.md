# HTML Projects

This repository contains beginner-level HTML projects I've built to practice and improve my web development skills.

📁 Projects

1. Registration Form
A simple HTML form where users can register by entering their name, email, password, age, and gender. It also includes a checkbox to accept terms before submission.

Skills Practiced:
- Forms and input types
- Semantic structure
- Labels and accessibility

2. Personal Portfolio Page
A small personal page that shares my hobbies, achievements, and fun facts. Includes semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. Users can also subscribe using a form and choose their favorite subjects.

Skills Practiced:
- Semantic HTML

- Forms with dropdowns, checkboxes, and textareas
- List elements (ordered and unordered)
